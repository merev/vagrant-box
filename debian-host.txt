## Automating the following steps is not considered a best practise. However, you can execute them manually with the root user.
## You should have created a user named 'vagrant'.

# Upgrade all installed packages:
apt-get update -y && apt-get upgrade -y

# Add new packages if you see fit. For example, install at least these (they are needed for building the VirtualBox modules):
apt-get install -y gcc make perl

# Insert the VirtualBox Add-ons media.

# Mount the VirtualBox Add-ons media and install them:
mount /dev/sr0 /mnt
/mnt/VBoxLinuxAdditions.run

# Reboot the system:
reboot

# Add the vagrant user to the vboxsf group:
usermod -aG vboxsf vagrant

# Add the vagrant user to the sudoers list and allow it to sudo without entering password:
echo "vagrant ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL" | tee /etc/sudoers.d/vagrant

# Create a folder to store the insecure key:
mkdir -m 0700 -p /home/vagrant/.ssh

# Install the vagrant insecure key:
wget --no-check-certificate https://raw.github.com/mitchellh/vagrant/master/keys/vagrant.pub -O /home/vagrant/.ssh/authorized_keys

# Change the permissions of the key:
chmod 0600 /home/vagrant/.ssh/authorized_keys

# Stop the auto update processes:
systemctl disable apt-daily.timer
systemctl disable apt-daily-upgrade.timer
systemctl disable --now unattended-upgrades.service

# Remove cloud init (if you want, if not then continue with the cache cleaning).

# Remove all data sources (selections) except the None one:
dpkg-reconfigure cloud-init

# Remove the package:
apt-get purge -y cloud-init

# Delete all leftovers as well:
rm -rf /etc/cloud/ && rm -rf /var/lib/cloud/

# Reboot the VM:
reboot

# Clean up the package cache:
apt-get clean

# Make sure that the hard disk is aligned:
dd if=/dev/zero of=/EMPTY bs=1M status=progress
rm -f /EMPTY

# Clean the history and reboot the VM:
history -c -w && cat /dev/null > .bash_history && reboot

# Create a folder on the host to store the box.

# In a terminal session, navigate to the folder created earlier.

# While the VM is still running, build the box by executing:
vagrant package --base <VM name>
