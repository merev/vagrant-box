## Automating the following steps is not considered a best practice. However, you can execute them manually with the root user.
## You should have created a user named 'vagrant'.

Upgrade all installed packages:
dnf upgrade -y

Add new packages if you see fit. For example, install at least these (they are needed for building the VirtualBox modules):
dnf install -y kernel-devel gcc make tar bzip2 wget elfutils-libelf-devel

Insert the VirtualBox Add-ons media.

Mount the VirtualBox Add-ons media and install them:
mount /dev/sr0 /mnt
/mnt/VBoxLinuxAdditions.run

Reboot the system:
reboot

Add the vagrant user to the vboxsf group:
usermod -aG vboxsf vagrant

Set the GRUB waiting time to 0 (this will make our machine boot faster):
vi /etc/default/grub
grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg

Add the vagrant user to the sudoers list and allow it to sudo without entering password:
echo "vagrant ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL" | tee /etc/sudoers.d/vagrant

Create a folder to store the insecure key:
mkdir -m 0700 -p /home/vagrant/.ssh

Install the vagrant insecure key:
wget --no-check-certificate https://raw.github.com/mitchellh/vagrant/master/keys/vagrant.pub -O /home/vagrant/.ssh/authorized_keys

Change the permissions of the key:
chmod 0600 /home/vagrant/.ssh/authorized_keys

Clean up the package cache:
dnf clean all

Make sure that the hard disk is aligned:
dd if=/dev/zero of=/EMPTY bs=1M status=progress
rm -f /EMPTY

Do not forget to eject (Optical Drives > Remove disk from virtual drive) the additions media or any other media that may be still attached to the machine.

Create a folder on the host to store the box.

In a terminal session, navigate to the folder created earlier.

While the VM is still running, build the box by executing:
vagrant package --base <VM name>
